This project presents an end-to-end data analysis case study for **HighCloud Airlines**, a fictional airline. It focuses on deriving meaningful business insights from flight operations data using SQL and visualizing them using Excel, Power BI and Tableau.



## Project Objective

To analyze airline operational data and uncover key insights such as:
- Load factor trends
- Top-performing carriers and routes
- Passenger preferences
- Weekly and financial quarter trends
- Distance-based flight categorization


## Tools & Technologies Used

**SQL (MySQL)**: For data cleaning, feature engineering, and complex queries
**Excel**: For quick data exploration and static dashboards
**Power BI**: For interactive dashboard design and visual storytelling
**Tableau**: For advanced visual analytics and business dashboard creation


## Key Business Questions Addressed

1. What is the load factor (passenger occupancy) across months, quarters, and years?
2. Which carrier names are most preferred by passengers?
3. Which routes (From-To cities) have the highest flight frequency?
4. How does load factor differ between weekdays and weekends?
5. How are flights distributed across different distance groups?
6. How to search for flights between specific source and destination locations?
